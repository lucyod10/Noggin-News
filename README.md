## Bugs

- tags on main page not working
- log in and out when on server (save to incorrect database?)
- on server, tag stays selected in newArticle section
- check red errors in console.
- when anonymous login, disable add button.
- add in red error message for errors in main
- tag toggle should give visual indication between hover and selected
- make save button inactive until all nerEntry inputs have data.
- article tag copy inconsistent with main tag copy
- loader after "enter" login 

## TODO

- make the 150 character collapse after 2 lines, and you can uncollapse it
- add username to database
- time sort articles
- Implement 2 modes:
  - personal mode, where you only see your own articles, and
  - group mode, where you see all articles.

- settings menu:
  - new Entry
  - log Out
  - my account
- redesign the reload database button
- new article- image
- rename and rebrand the project.
- newArticle page: input box max-width
- one column layout
- add rules to restrict access
- allow user to create own tags
