# Blog

This is a simple blog platform I have built using javascript, HTML/CSS, and firebase.

## TODO

- all articles have filters
- add username to database
- time sort articles
- Implement 2 modes:
  - personal mode, where you only see your own articles, and
  - group mode, where you see all articles.

- settings menu:
  - new Entry
  - log Out
  - my account
- redesign the reload database button
- new article- image
- rename and rebrand the project.
